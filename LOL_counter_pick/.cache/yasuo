COUNTER_TIPS
Yasuo's shield from Resolve lasts only 2 seconds. Dealing damage to him will trigger it. Wait it out, then engage
Yasuo is at his weakest just after he has launched a whirlwind. Engage at that point
Fighting Yasuo away from minions and neutral monsters will limit his mobility. His skirmish potential is very good as well because of this, so be careful when initiating 2v2 and 3v3's
